Both this dir and /lisp/yasnippets/snippets are to be loaded.
After adding the new snippets, there's an option in YASnippet menu to reload everything.

有key:sm的话, sm然后trigger. 若此项为空, 则以文件名为trigger.

$0 代表光标的位置.
Example
-------
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: org-src-matlab
# key: sm
# --
#+begin_src matlab
$0
#+end_src
